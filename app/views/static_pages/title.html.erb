		<p>Paxxa was an Iranian toddler who was abducted by extraterrestrials during the Tehran UFO Incident in 1976. He was taken to Raquesti home world orbiting a binary sun. He was assimilated into Raquesti culture and has returned to earth as a missionary for an alien religion.  He befriends a dysfunctionally nostalgic, former physics professor.  When they create a device that seems to use higher dimensions to enhance &ldquo;psychic abilities&rdquo;, they reluctantly become involved in a resistance movement against a despotic theocracy.</p>
