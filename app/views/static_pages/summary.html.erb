    <h1>Summary</h1>   
<p>Hundreds of UFO’s; glowing discs 1000 meters across, appear in the skies of earth. They make no contact or interfere in any way. They hover over major cities for a year and depart as suddenly as they arrived. They leave nothing behind except well documented evidence of their existence and the question as to why they where here.  There are several unexplained disappearances of people around the globe, including an Iranian toddler and his family.</p>

<p>In the social anarchy caused by the visitation, a televangelist, Javier Ronsen (JR), gains a large following due his charisma and his explanation of the visitation. He claims the UFOs resemble the “angels” he saw during a near death experience. He believes the angels were sent to evaluate the earth a prelude to armageddon. Their departure without doing anything is a sign that they have given us another chance to return to a “righteous” society. With his group of followers and a renegade General, JR is able to overthrow the government and establish a Theocracy built around his church. [Rise of the Televangelist]</p>

<p>Paxxa returns on a smaller version of the original UFOs. It does not actually land, but hovers a few feet above of the East River adjacent to former United Nations building which JR has made the seat of his government. The glow diminishes and Paxxa crosses a gang plank to address the gathered assembly at the UN. He says he wants to share the knowledge of the Raquesti with the people of earth. He ends his speech with the words, “Let Me Help”. Paxxa and JR form a partnership to improve the life of all.</p>

<p>Since establishing the Theocracy, JR has had to deal with the annoyance of groups with other interpretations of the UFOs. These groups have become a marginalized minority, denied the benefits of those living under the rule of the Theocracy. These groups are now drawn to Paxxa, seeking his validation. JR create the Institute for Raquesti Studies, with Paxxa as it's head. In this way, JR hopes to be able to influence these groups through Paxxa. Paxxa travels throughout the Theocracy setting up branch campuses of the IRS and communes for the marginalized. He begins to see the injustice at how they are treated.</p>

<p>Paxxa  gains a following among the  marginalized. JR becomes worried at his growing power and begins to see him as a threat. JR begins a campaign to discredit Paxxa. Nicole and her Gestapo begin hounding Paxxa. Paxxa seeks refuge with the underground resistance, the Machi, that is born in the communes.</p>

<p>Working in his lab in Fontana Dam, Greg Macsen creates a device based on his theory that there is a counterpart to a Black Hole which he has termed a “White Bubble”. A Black Hole allows matter to escape our space-time. In contrast, a White Bubble allows a special type of energy to seep into our space-time from the Bulk (M-Theory reference).  The purpose of the device is to create a White Bubble, opening a hole in our space-time to allow the Bulk’s energy to trickle through. When the device is turned on, a small white sphere appears in the device containment field. Seeing the sphere, Greg at first thinks he has achieved his goal. But as he tries to measure the energy, his instruments only register the light being reflected/refracted by the sphere. Unknown to Greg, the device lacks the ability to sustain the hole Greg was trying to create and what started as a hole, became a tunnel as the hole attaches itself to another point in our space-time.</p>

<p>Greg stares at the sphere and falls asleep. He has an incredibly vivid dream of a past time with his estranged wife, Dot.  Greg soon learns that whenever he falls asleep staring at the sphere, he has these vivid dreams. Greg does not realize what is happening is  when he focuses on the sphere to the exclusion of all else, his perception is of what is at the other end of the tunnel. Where/when the other side of the tunnel attaches itself depends on Greg’s thoughts and emotions when it is created. His focus is so complete that through the sphere he can experience a complete perception of the other side as if he were actually there.  The experience is perception only and he is unable to interact within the experience.</p>

<p>Greg never got over the emotional loss of his wife’s leaving. He goes to “dream” with the sphere more and more to remember the happier times with Dot.  Greg becomes addicted to literally reliving the past. He displays all the symptoms of an addict, including listlessness when he is not “dreaming”, forgetting more important activities (ie eating), withdrawn.</p>

<p>Paxxa and Greg meet. Greg guards the secret of the device. Unknown to Greg,  Paxxa witnesses Greg using the device. Because of his empathic abilities, Paxxa understands what Greg is doing. After slowly gaining Greg’s trust, Paxxa reveals the science behind the device. Greg begins to understand and shows the device to Paxxa. </p>

<p>Paxxa and Greg work together to improve the device, creating a smaller version, the Black Box. Using a meditation/hypnotic technique that Paxxa learned on Raquesti, they are able to create a seed in their consciousness  that will determine the endpoint of the tunnel when the Black Box is switched on. They discover they can continue to view the other side as long as they simply observe without thinking about the physical reality on their side of the tunnel.  They are able to view the present as well as the past.  They are unable to see the future because of the infinite possibilities the future represents. When they try all they can see is a shifting, multi-color, fractal kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>Nicole, a past friend of Dot and now head of the Theocracy’s Gestapo, has been visiting Greg to gloat over his loss of Dot. Nicole has an attraction to Dot and was instrumental in her break up with Greg by intriducing Dot th the Church on which the Theocracy is based. When Greg is addicted to the device, Nicole takes pleasure in seeing Greg as a broken man. But when Paxxa teams up with Greg, Nicole notices a positive change in Greg. Nicole endeavors to find out the cause of the change in Greg so that she can reverse to make Greg as despondent as he was before.  Nicole discovers the device, but Greg and Paxxa take the device to hide with the Resistance underground.  Nicole informs JR, the head of the Theocracy about the device and together, with the General (leader of the Theocracy’s military and key figure in the coup d'etat that put the Theocracy in power) they begin a campaign to  capture the Black Box.</p>

<p>The Black Box is captured by the Theocracy.  Greg and Paxxa turn to the Resistance for help to  plan a clandestine attempt to steal it back. None of JR’s staff has been able to determine how the Black Box works. During the attempt to steal back the Black Box, Paxxa is captured and brought before the General.  The General demands Paxxa tell him how to use the Black Box. Paxxa refuses and is physically tortured, including being beaten.  JR comes to witness the General’s attempts to make Paxxa reveal the secret of the Black Box. JR sees the General’s techniques are ineffective. JR puts a gun to Paxxa’s head saying that if Paxxa does not tell them, there is no point in keeping him alive. JR gives Paxxa the Black Box and tells him he has one last chance. At this moment, Paxxa discovers that he can transport himself through the tunnel created by the Black Box. JR and the General watch as the room where Paxxa lies distorts like a sheet of rubber being stretched away from them.  Paxxa appears to become smaller as he moves toward the vanishing point. The room snaps back to its flat state, but Paxxa is no longer there. JR and the General begin to argue, each accusing the other of allowing Paxxa to escape. JR shoots the GEneral in the head, killing him. Nicole becomes the defacto head of the military.</p>

<p>Bloodied and barely able to stand, Paxxa suddenly appears amid a meeting of the Resistance leaders and Greg. Paxxa explains what has happened and that the Black Box was left behind. Paxxa’s spaceship rescues him because of his injuries and returns him to Raquesti.</p>
